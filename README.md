📘 Description
The Cryptic Message Decoder is a simple Java console program that demonstrates the use of variables, operators, and mathematical expressions to decode a given number into a “secret code.”
This challenge avoids loops and conditional statements — relying solely on arithmetic operations and the Math class.

🧩 Features
Reads a multi-digit number as input.
Extracts the first, last, second, and second-last digits using math operations.
Calculates:
The product of the first and last digits.
The sum of the second and second-last digits.
Concatenates both results to form the final decoded message.
